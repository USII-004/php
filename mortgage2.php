<!-- 
Write a function that is able to calculate a mortgage loan using the following:

Loans from 5,000 - 9,999 uses 2.5% Interest rate

Loans from 10,000 - 19,999 uses 3.5% Interest rate

Loans from 20,000 - 49,999, uses 4% Interest rate

Loans from 50,000 and above, uses 6% Interest rate

Formula for calculation:

Simple Interest= Principal x Rate x Time รท (100 x 12)

Amount Payable = Principal + simpleInterest 
 -->

 <?php

$principal= $_POST['principal'];
$duration= $_POST['duration'];

// this is how you call a variable that will get values from the user. we use use the post because our form method is post also the name we used in the array above must correspond to our form input name, in our case name and duration respectively. 

public function rate($amount) {
    if ($amount >= 5000 && $amount <= 9999) {
        return 2.5;
    } elseif ($amount >= 10000 && $amount <= 19999) {
        return 3.5;
    } elseif ($amount >= 20000 && $amount <= 49999) {
        return 4;
    } elseif ($amount >= 50000) {
        return 6;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}

$interestRate= rate($principal);

// I created a differernt function to assign a rate this way my code is way smaller. notice that i used the rate function in thevariable inteerestRate  

public function simpleInterest($principal, $interestRate, $duration) {
    return ($principal * $interestRate * $duration) / (100 * 12);
}

// A different function to calculate the simple interest

$mortgageLoan = simpleInterest($principal, $interestRate, $duration);

// The variable mortgageLoan now calculate the simple Interest using the values gotten from the user.

$amountPayable = $principal + $mortgageLoan;

// The variable a mount payable gives the total amount the usere is expected to pay
